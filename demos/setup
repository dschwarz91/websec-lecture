NOTE: all the stuff here is deliberately very insecure! Never deploy on a productive server!

install apache, mod-php, mod-xml, mysql/maria-db
update apache- and php-config according to ./apache.conf
add the apache-user to the adm group so he can read the apache logfiles (needed for lightside/troubleshooting.php) and has some special privileges
add darkside.me and lightside.me to hosts files (on all involved machines)

# Web Security Lecture
This material was initially created for the lecture part of a web security university class at [FH St. Pölten](https://www.fhstp.ac.at/de/studium-weiterbildung/informatik-security/it-security) (~15h lecture, divided into four days) and is intended for beginners and intermediates in this specialised field as well as for all levels of web developers.

Please let me know about mistakes, errors, improvement ideas, etc. by creating a github issue or just texting me - it will be highly appreciated.

## Setup
Everything you need to setup the demos is listed in [demos/setup](./demos/setup).

**Important**: The setup and all the demos are deliberately very insecure for demonstration purposes! Never deploy them on a productive server!

To include an active part for the students as well as to gather some feedback I like to do little anonymous quizzes during the lecture. A possible tool I already tried is [Pingo](https://pingo.coactum.de/) which works pretty well. However, because of some minor but still annoying bugs I consider switching to another tool for future lectures. Some possible questions are located in [quizzes](./quizzes).  

## Open TODOs for demos
 * replacing XmlHttpRequests() with fetch()
 * adding Python examples (currently everything is in PHP)

## Open TODOs for slides
They are directly mentioned in the pptx comments. (some of these comments are only in german right now - sorry for that)

## Related work and acknowledgements
